String-list examples:

1. Write a program that takes your full name as input and displays the abbreviations of the first and middle names except the last name which is displayed as it is. 
Example:
input: Alakh Janakkumar Pandya
output: A.J.Pandya
2. Write a program to find the number of vowels, consonents and white space characters in a given string.
Example:
input string: Python Programming
output:
vowels: 4
whitel spaces: 1
consonents: 13
3.  Write a Python code that prints the index numbers of all the occurrences of "o" in a given string of length 5.
4. Write a program to make a new string with the word "the" deleted in the given string.
eg:
input string: This is the lion in the cage.
output: This is lion in cage.
5. Write a Python code that asks a string from user and replace the first occurance of " " with "_" and last occurance of " " with "#".

Example:
input string: Keep yourself mute while not speaking.
output: Keep_yourself mute while not#speaking.
6. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Now, copy all the elements in another list but in reverse order. Now print both the lists.
7. Ask 10 numbers from the user and store them in a list. Now, ask user to enter a number between 1 to 10. Delete the element present at that index number and print the list. Now aks user to enter the number that he/she wants to delete. Delete that number itself from the list and print the resultant list.

If-else examples:
1. A school has following grading system. Write a Python code that takes percentage of a student and display his/her grade.
below 35%       :   F
from 35 to 44   :   E
from 45 to 54   :   D
from 55 to 64   :   C
from 65 to 74   :   B
75 or more      :   A

2. Write a Python program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not. 
Test Data : 2016
Expected Output :
2016 is a leap year.

3. Write a Python program to find the largest of three numbers. 
Test Data : 12 25 52
Expected Output :
1st Number = 12
2nd Number = 25
3rd Number = 52

52 is the largest number.

4. Write a Python program to accept a coordinate point in a XY coordinate system and determine in which quadrant the coordinate point lies. 
Test Data : 
x-coordinate: 7
y-coordinate: 9
Expected Output :
The coordinate point (7,9) lies in the First quadrant.
